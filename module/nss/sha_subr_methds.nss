// :: Below lies the list of all the functions useable OnModuleLoad to setup
// :: a subrace.



//:: - ALL SUBRACE RELATED METHODS MUST BE CALLED AFTER THIS METHOD! -
//:: -- The Main function. Call this OnModuleLoad.
//
// ::Race:   This is the base race that you want to create your subrace from
// ::        Use ONLY: RACIAL_TYPE_ALL, or RACIAL_TYPE_DWARF, RACIAL_TYPE_ELF,
// ::                  RACIAL_TYPE_GNOME, RACIAL_TYPE_HALFELF, RACIAL_TYPE_HALFLING,
// ::                  RACIAL_TYPE_HALFORC, or RACIAL_TYPE_HUMAN.
// ::       If you want to add additional races that can become part of this subrace call
// ::       AddAdditionalBaseRaceToSubrace() AFTER this method.
//
// ::SubraceName:   The subrace's name. This is what the PC will have to type in his/her
// ::               Subrace field. DO NOT HAVE SPACES IN NAMES.
// ::               IE: Use "Dark-elf" NOT "Dark elf".
// ::               (Not case sensitive.)
//
// ::HideResRef:    This is the resref of the Creature Hide/Skin you want to equip on the PC.
// ::               This will have all the subrace traits like ability modifiers and base feats etc.
//
// ::                If you do not want a skin, write either "none" or leave it as blank.
//
// ::UniqueItemResref:   This is the resref of the item that you want given to the player. For example this item
// ::                    could hold can spells on it, or just description of the subrace. Ideally this item will not be droppable,
// ::                    and is marked as being a plot item. Regardless of what type of item this is it will be given to player when they enter the module.
// ::                    (If they lose it or drop it they will again get it back on the next time they enter).
//
// ::                    If you do not want to give the PC a unique item then, write either "none" or leave it as blank.
//
// ::IsLightSensitive:   Set to TRUE if the subrace is light senstive. IE: Blinded when in Sunlight and/or gets saves and AB decreases.
// ::                    If the PC does not pass the fort saving throw, then it is blinded for that round.
// ::                    The DC for the saving throw can be changed by changing the value of
// ::                    LIGHT_SENSITIVE_SAVING_THROW_DC in the file sha_subr_consts. Also you can change the interval (rounds) between each time the PC
// ::                    is 'struk' by light by changing the value of LIGHT_BLINDNESS_STRIKES_EVERY_ROUND.  And also you can change the number of rounds
// ::                    the PC stays blinded for if it fails the saving throw by changing tha value of LIGHT_STRUCK_BLIND_FOR_ROUNDS.
//
// ::                    If APPLY_AB_AND_SAVING_THROW_DECREASES_IN_LIGHT is set to TRUE, then the PC also suffers
// ::                    an attack bonus decrease of LIGHT_AB_DECREASE and saving throw decrease of LIGHT_SAVE_DECREASE for a number of rounds
// ::                    determined by: LIGHT_CAUSES_AB_AND_SAVES_DECREASE_FOR_ROUNDS.
//
// ::                    Rememeber: IF YOU CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE CONSTANTS FILE, IT WILL APPLY TO ALL SUBRACES.
// ::                               (IE: If you change the DC for the saving throw then all subraces that have light sensitivity will have to make that saving throw).
//
// ::DamageTakenWhileInLight:  The amount of divine Damage the PC suffers ever round while
// ::                          it is in sunlight. Note: PC does not necessarily have to be Light Sensitive
// ::                          for this to work.
// ::                          If this value is negative then the PC will regenerate that amount.
//
// ::IsUndergroundSensitive:   Same as IsLightSenstive but this applies when the PC is in
// ::                          Underground type of areas. This does not mean the PC is affected by Night time.
//
// ::DamageTakenWhileInUnderground:  The amount of Negative Damage taken per round while in the Underground.
// ::                                 Note: This too doesn't need the PC to be Under ground sensitive to apply.
// ::                                 If this value is negative then the PC will regenerate that amount.
//
// :: ECL:          Effective Character Level: Use any integer value.
// ::                 (For those that do not know what this is...
// ::                   Effective Character Level is a way of lessening your subrace's bonus abilities
// ::                   by reducing the amount of experience points gained per kill.)
// ::                   IE: If you have a Subrace with ECL of 3, then a PC (Player character) of level 10 belonging to
// ::                       that subrace is regarded being level 13 when gaining XP points per kill.
// ::                       Thus will get less experience points.
// ::                       NOTE: This can work for negative values as well.
//
// :: IsUndead:             Mark the PC belonging to this sub-race as being Undead. It will mean that Healing spells will hurt the PC.
// ::                       And harming spells will heal the PC.
//
// :: PrestigiousSubrace:   Mark this sub-race as being prestigious. Which means players can't become part of it when they enter in with a level 1 character with this as their chosen subrace.
// ::                      (Set this to TRUE, if you are making a subrace that players can become part of once they reach a certain level in another sub-race)
// ::                       -Refer to SetupSubraceSwitch() for more information -
//
// :: Example:  You wish to create a subrace called Drow, and you have created a Creature Skin/Hide in the toolset with
// ::          resref "sha_pc_drow". The Unique item (which contains spell like abilities and information about the Drow subrace)
// ::          has the resref "sha_subrace_drow". And you want to make the Drow light sensitive and take 2 divine damage while in light areas.
// ::          Also you would like to mark the Drow as having an Effective Character level of +1.
// ::          Simply call this OnModuleLoad. (Remember to #include "sha_subr_methds", in the script)
//
// ::          CreateSubrace(RACIAL_TYPE_ELF, "drow", "sha_pc_drow", "sha_subrace_drow", TRUE, 2, FALSE, 0, 1);

// :: struct SubraceStats  mystats = CreateCustomeStats(<fill in appropriate values. Look at CreateCustomeStats method for more details>).
//
// :: then you want to add this to your subrace. So call

//(The use of this function is slightly more complicated)
//
// ::       StatModiferType: Use only SUBRACE_STAT_MODIFIER_TYPE_PERCENTAGE (if you wish to increase or decrease a PC's ability scores/AC/AB based on the percentage of the PC's current ability scores)
// ::                         or SUBRACE_STAT_MODIFIER_TYPE_POINTS (if you wish to increase or decrease a PC's ability scores/AC/AB by constant number.

//
// ::Example: You wish to change reduce the PC's strength by 80% and increase it's dexterity by 50% and increase it's consitituion by 60%, whilst you want to increase the AC by 65%, but reduce the AB by 10%.
//
// ::so you create your stats:
